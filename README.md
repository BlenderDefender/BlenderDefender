### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My artists name is Blender Defender and I'm a Blender 3D Artist and Blender Addons Programmer.

My vision is to declare Blender as good as even possible and make Tutorials, that you don't just follow along but after which you know what the settings do and you can change them to your own benefit.

Currently, I produce quick tip videos for you, so that you can pick up very important knowledge quickly. You can [find my Youtube channel here.](https://www.youtube.com/blenderdefender)

## About me


I am a young Blender Artist from Germany. I've discovered Blender more than 3 years ago and have been using it ever since. From then on, I've got myself familiar with the concepts of 3D.


My favorite tool in Blender is definitely the Node Editor since I'm a huge fan of the concept of proceduralism/non-destructive modeling.

<!-- ## Where do I see myself in 4 years?

In 4 years, when we're all living a regular life again, I want to have grown and established my YouTube channel and my free Addons. I also hope to have started living my vision with the help of the Blender Community.

From an artistic point of view, I desire to have worked on multiple projects. Private and small GIMP-Projects, as well as medium and bigger Blender-Projects.
From a programmer point of view, I want to have a good knowledge so I can program for [Blender.](https://www.blender.org/)
